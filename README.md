# VBA-challenge

In this assignment, I utilized two workbooks to develop a script that would yield meaningful data covering three years of stock value increases and decreases.

The script "VBA Stock Analysis.bas" can be imported into Excel's Visual Basic to run for both the Alphetical Testing workbook, and the Multiple Year Stock Data workbook, which contains the true data we are analyzing.

The final results of my analysis (2014 Data.PNG, 2015 Data.PNG, and 2016 Data.PNG) have been committed, as well.
