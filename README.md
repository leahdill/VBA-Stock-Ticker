# VBA-challenge

For this assignment, I utilized a tester workbook and to develop a script that would yield meaningful data covering three years of stock value increases and decreases.

The script "VBA Stock Analysis.bas" can be imported into Excel's Visual Basic to run for both the Alphetical Testing workbook, and the Multiple Year Stock Data workbook, which contains the true data we are analyzing.

The final results of my analysis (2014 Data.PNG, 2015 Data.PNG, and 2016 Data.PNG) are available to view.

Credits: 
The final activities in our week of learning VBA contributed heavily to how I approached formatting my script and defining my variables. Fellow students and our instructor also assisted meaningfully with errors posted in Slack.
